# Machine Learning
 This is a portfolio of all the case studies / projects I have prepared using Machine learning algorithms (Non-Deep Learning). These include Supervised, Unsupervised projects as well as Recommendation Engine related projects <br>
Highlights:<br>
<ul>
<li>Skills: Basic statistical analysis - ANOVA, Chi-square, two-sample t-test and correlation analytics</li><br>
<li>Approaches: Univariate / Bi-variate EDA, PCA , Regularization, K-fold cross validation</li><br>
<li>Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib , Seaborn, Scikit-Learn</li><br>
<li>Algorithms: KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Ensemble Models -GradientBoosting, XGBoost, RandomForestRegressor, AdaBoost</li><br>
<li>Hyperparameter Search: Grid Search, Random Search, Manual hyperparameter searches</li><br>
</ul>
