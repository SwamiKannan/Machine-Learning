## Data:
The insurance.csv dataset contains 1338 observations and 7 attributes. The data contains medical costs of people characterized by certain attributes. 

## Data source:

## Attributes:
Age: age of primary beneficiary
Sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male
BMI: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

## Key asks:
•	Do charges of people who smoke differ significantly from the people who don't?
•	Does BMI of males differ significantly from that of females?
•	Is the proportion of smokers significantly different in different genders?
•	Is the distribution of BMI across women with no children, one child and two children the same?
