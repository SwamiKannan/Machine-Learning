# CTC-34 Concrete Compressive Strength prediction
## Data:
This dataset is in the repository.
The concrete compressive strength of concrete is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients.
Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.
